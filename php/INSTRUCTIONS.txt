KILO.HEALTH application task part no. 1 by Edvinas Å½elnys

what I did is written some tests and refactored the code as it was said in the project requirements. The rule to not alter the "Item" class was a really unfortunate as
without any changes to the class I was not able to refactor the code as I would've liked, or just could't think of a way to do it.

What i did was implement tests to basically see if every rule in the requirements apply as it should. Changed, the updateQuality() function to make it easier to
understand, read, alter or add to it, also changes to the object was made to take one item at a time and not the whole array, for simplicity. Function type() was
added to return the desired item for testing.

HOW TO RUN:
open up terminal and go to the folder you've cloned the repository
navigate to - [your folder name]\GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata\php
run command - composer test

NOTE" please make sure you have composer intalled in the php directory, if any problem occurs in the same folder type in command - composer install

Thank you!
