KILO.HEALTH application task part no. 1 by Edvinas Å½elnys

what I did is written some tests and refactored the code as it was said in the project requirements.

UPDATE:
"GildedRose.php" now only has the type function that basically directs any data to the correct class accoding to the item name.
"Item.php" has your usuall constructor and updateQuality() function for regular items
Every other Item class (AgedBrie, Backstage, Conjured, Sulfuras) now inherits the parent Item class. This allows the classes to be
neat and tidy as only updateQuality() functions with the iternal logic are required.
This makes adding/deleting new Items an ease.

HOW TO RUN:
open up terminal and go to the folder you've cloned the repository
navigate to - [your folder name]\GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata\php
run command - composer test

NOTE: please make sure you have composer installed in the php directory, if any problem occurs in the same folder type in command - composer install

Thank you!
